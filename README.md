# leaf particles! 

This sample project simulates a box in which 500 leaf sprites are generated. 

The leaves are modeled as circles which can be affected by Spritekit's world gravity and an impulse force enacted by the user's touch. 

Rotate the screen or draw on the screen to 'blow' on the leaves. 

There are 150 'real' leaves with physics bodies attached that collide with one another

And there are 350 'dummy' leaves that only collide with the floor of the physics world. 

500 total leaves in all, they are all affected by the 'wind' force which your finger swipes will impart. The 'wind' force will be applied to all leaves that are around 40 pts in proximity to your touch point.
